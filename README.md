# Community Protection Service (CPS) #BONAZONKE

### Developed by Kgotso Mphuthi

## 1. Project Overview

Welcome to my web stack portfolio project. For this project, I developed the **Community Protection Service (CPS)**, a backend framework designed to tackle the real-world problem of slow emergency response times in urban areas, inspired by the needs of communities like my home in Soweto, Gauteng.

My goal was to architect and build a robust, secure, and intelligent system from the ground up. It serves as the core command-and-control logic for a network of automated surveillance drones and coordinated ground units. The system is not only reactive, responding to incidents by dispatching the **geographically closest drone** for the fastest response time, but also proactive, using data analysis to identify potential crime hotspots for preventative patrols.

This project showcases a full development lifecycle, from initial architectural design to implementing advanced business logic, data analysis, and professional-grade security.

## 2. Core Features Implemented

This is more than a simple CRUD application. I have engineered several advanced, real-world features to demonstrate a deep understanding of backend systems development:

* **Intelligent Asset Dispatch:** The system uses geospatial calculations (`geopy`) to identify and dispatch the drone that is geographically closest to a new incident, ensuring the fastest possible response time.
* **Predictive Hotspot Analysis:** An analytics endpoint (`/api/analytics/hotspots`) processes historical incident data to identify and report on high-density crime zones, enabling a shift from reactive to proactive policing.
* **Secure, Token-Based Authentication:** The entire API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). All data-centric endpoints are protected and require a valid token, which is obtained via a dedicated `/login` route that validates credentials against securely hashed passwords.
* **Simulated Third-Party Integration:** The dispatch service includes a simulation of communicating with an external Air Traffic Control (ATC) service, complete with realistic network delays, demonstrating the ability to design systems that integrate with external APIs.
* **Comprehensive Data Modeling:** The database schema is designed with clear relationships between multiple resources, including stations, drones, users, ground units, incidents, and flight plans, all managed via a professional migration workflow.

## 3. Technology Choices & Architecture

I carefully selected the following technologies to build a modern and professional application.

* **Language: Python** & **Framework: Flask**
* **Database Engine: SQLite**
* **ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy & Flask-Migrate**
* **Geospatial Calculations: `geopy`**
* **Security: Flask-JWT-Extended**
* **API Documentation: Flasgger (Swagger)**
* **Demonstration Tool: `ngrok`**

My architectural approach focuses on a clean separation of concerns and plans for future growth by allowing complex features like image analysis to be built out as independent microservices.

## 4. Local Setup and Daily Workflow

This project was developed within an ephemeral Linux environment. The following steps outline both the one-time setup and the daily startup routine required to run the application in such an environment.

### One-Time Setup

These steps only need to be performed once when first cloning the project.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git](https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git)
    cd cps-bonazonke
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  **Initialize the Database Migrations Folder:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    ```

### Daily Startup Routine

Because the environment is ephemeral, the virtual environment and installed packages may not persist between sessions. **This routine must be followed every time you start a new terminal session.**

1.  **Activate the Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    # First, create the venv if it doesn't exist
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Then, activate it
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Install All Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create/Update the Database:**
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```
4.  **(Recommended) Seed the Database:**
    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```
5.  **Start the Server:** In your **first terminal**, run the application server.
    ```bash
    flask run --host=0.0.0.0
    ```

---

## 5. Testing the API

With the server running, open a **second terminal** and activate the environment (`source venv/bin/activate`). You must log in to get an access token before testing other features.

### Step 1: Log In and Get Your Token

Use the credentials for `operator1` (password: `password123`), which were created by the `seed.py` script.

```bash
curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login) \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "username": "operator1",
    "password": "password123"
}'
```

This will return an access_token. Copy the long string of characters inside the quotes.

### Step 2: Test a Protected Endpoint

Store the token in a shell variable and use it to access a protected route.

```bash
Replace <COPIED_TOKEN> with the actual token you copied
TOKEN="<COPIED_TOKEN>"
```

### Now, use the token to test the analytics endpoint

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/analytics/hotspots](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/analytics/hotspots)
```

### 6. Live API Documentation via ngrok

To view the interactive API documentation from an external browser, a secure tunnel is required. I have included ngrok in this project for that purpose.

One-Time ngrok Setup
Download ngrok:

```bash

curl -L [https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz](https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz) --output ngrok-v3.tgz

Extract the file:
tar -xvzf ngrok-v3.tgz

Authenticate ngrok: Sign up for a free account at ngrok.com to get your authtoken.
```

### Replace <YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN> with the token from your ngrok dashboard

./ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN>
Running ngrok for Demonstration
Start the Flask Server in Terminal 1 (as described in the daily workflow).

In a second terminal, start the ngrok tunnel:

```bash
./ngrok http 5000
Copy the public https URL provided by ngrok (it will look like https://random-string.ngrok-free.app).

Open your browser and navigate to that URL, adding /apidocs to the end.

Example: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/apidocs
```
This will load the full, interactive Swagger UI documentation for all API endpoints.
