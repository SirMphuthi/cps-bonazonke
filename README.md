## 1. Overview

The Community Protection Service (CPS) is a backend application designed to power a next-generation, rapid-response security system for urban communities. The core concept is to drastically reduce response times to crime alerts by leveraging a network of automated surveillance drones dispatched from local stations.

When an incident is reported, the system identifies the nearest available drone, requests airspace clearance from a simulated aviation authority, and dispatches the drone to provide real-time aerial footage and location data to ground support units. This project serves as the foundational backend framework for such a system.

This project was developed to meet the criteria of the Web Stack Portfolio Project, focusing on backend architecture, API design, database management, and simulating real-world regulatory compliance.
