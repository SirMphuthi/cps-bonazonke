# Community Protection Service (CPS) #BONAZONKE

### Developed by Kgotso Mphuthi

## 1. Project Overview

Welcome to my web stack portfolio project. For this project, I developed the **Community Protection Service (CPS)**, a backend framework designed to tackle the real-world problem of slow emergency response times in urban areas.

My goal was to design and build a robust, secure, and scalable system that could serve as the core logic for a network of automated surveillance drones. The system manages incident reports, identifies available drones, simulates a flight clearance process, and secures its endpoints using token-based authentication. This project demonstrates my ability to architect a complete backend solution from the ground up to solve a complex problem.

## 2. Technology Choices & Architecture

I carefully selected the following technologies to build a modern and professional application.

* **Language: Python** & **Framework: Flask**
    * **Why:** I chose Flask for its flexibility, which allowed me to design a custom architecture from scratch and implement professional patterns like application factories and service layers.

* **Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite**
    * **Why:** The application is designed to use PostgreSQL for its robustness and data integrity in a production-like environment. For simplicity in development and demonstration, it is configured to use SQLite, showcasing its adaptability to different database backends.

* **ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy & Flask-Migrate**
    * **Why:** I used SQLAlchemy to interact with the database in a more Pythonic way. To manage changes to the database schema safely as the models evolved, I integrated Flask-Migrate.

* **Security: Flask-JWT-Extended**
    * **Why:** To secure the API, I implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT), the industry standard for stateless authentication in modern web services. This ensures that data can only be accessed by authorized users.

* **API Documentation: Flasgger**
    * **Why:** Clear documentation is essential. I implemented Flasgger to auto-generate a live, interactive Swagger UI page, making my API easily understandable and testable.

## 3. Local Setup and Installation

To get the project running on your local machine, you will need Python 3.8+ and the necessary build tools.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git](https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git)
cd cps-bonazonke
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Environment
```bash
# Create and activate the Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all the required packages from the pinned list
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: If the above command fails on a fresh system, you may need to install system-level development tools first with `sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev`)*

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create your local `.env` file by copying the template. This file tells the application how to connect to the database and what secret keys to use.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(The default configuration is set up to use a local SQLite database file, which requires no extra setup.)*

## 4. Database Initialization

Before running the app, you must create the database file and its tables.

1.  **Initialize the migrations folder** (only needs to be run once per project):
    ```bash
    flask db init
    ```
2.  **Generate the migration script:**
    ```bash
    flask db migrate -m "Initial database schema"
    ```
3.  **Apply the migrations to create the tables:**
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```
4.  **(Recommended) Seed the database** with sample data for a clean demonstration. This script will wipe existing data first.
    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```

---

## 5. Running the Application

Once the database is initialized, you can start the Flask development server. This terminal window must be kept running.
```bash
flask run
```
The API is now live and available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 6. How to Test the Secure API

Once the server is running, open a **second terminal** with the virtual environment activated (`source venv/bin/activate`). Since the API is now secure, you must log in to get an access token before you can test other features.

### Step 1: Log In and Get Your Token

Use the credentials for `operator1` (password: `password123`), which were created by the `seed.py` script.

```bash
curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login) \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "username": "operator1",
    "password": "password123"
}'
```
This will return an `access_token`. **Copy the long string of characters inside the quotes.**

### Step 2: Test a Protected Endpoint

Now, you can use that token to access any protected route. We will store it in a shell variable for convenience.

```bash
# Replace <COPIED_TOKEN> with the actual token you copied
TOKEN="<COPIED_TOKEN>"

# Now, use the token to get the list of drones
curl [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/drones](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/drones) -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
This workflow of logging in and using the returned token is how modern, secure APIs are tested and used.

## 7. Interactive API Documentation

For a more user-friendly way to explore the API, I have integrated Flasgger to provide a live Swagger UI documentation page.

* **How to access:** While the Flask server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    **`http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs`**
