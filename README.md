# Community Protection Service (CPS) #BONAZONKE

### Developed by Kgotso Mphuthi

## 1. Project Overview

Welcome to my web stack portfolio project. For this project, I developed the **Community Protection Service (CPS)**, a backend framework designed to tackle the real-world problem of slow emergency response times in urban areas.

My goal was to design and build a robust, scalable system that could serve as the core logic for a network of automated surveillance drones. The system manages incident reports, identifies available drones, and simulates a flight clearance process with an aviation authority before dispatching a unit. This project demonstrates my ability to architect a complete backend solution from the ground up to solve a complex problem.

## 2. Technology Choices & Architecture

I carefully selected the following technologies to build a robust and modern application, keeping flexibility, reliability, and professional standards in mind.

* **Language: Python** & **Framework: Flask**
    * **Why:** I chose Flask for its flexibility, which allowed me to design a custom architecture and implement professional patterns like application factories and service layers.
* **Database: PostgreSQL**
    * **Why:** For an application dealing with critical data, I chose PostgreSQL for its proven reliability and data integrity features.
* **ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy & Flask-Migrate**
    * **Why:** I used SQLAlchemy to interact with the database in a more Pythonic way. To manage changes to the database schema safely as I developed the models, I integrated Flask-Migrate.
* **API Documentation: Flasgger**
    * **Why:** Clear documentation is essential. I implemented Flasgger to auto-generate a live, interactive Swagger UI page, making my API easily understandable and testable.

## 3. Local Setup and Installation

To get the project running on your local machine, please follow these steps. You will need Python 3.8+ and PostgreSQL installed.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git](https://github.com/your-username/cps-bonazonke.git)
cd cps-bonazonke
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Environment
```bash
# Create and activate the Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all the required packages from the pinned list
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the PostgreSQL Database
```bash
# Log into PostgreSQL as the default admin user
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create the database and user for this project
CREATE DATABASE cps_db;
CREATE USER cps_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cps_db TO cps_user;
\q
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create your local `.env` file by copying the template.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the new `.env` file and ensure the `DATABASE_URL` is correct (the password is 'password' if you followed Step 3 exactly).

## 4. Database Initialization

Before running the app for the first time, you must create the database tables.

1.  **Initialize the migrations folder** (only needs to be run once per project):
    ```bash
    flask db init
    ```
2.  **Generate the migration script:**
    ```bash
    flask db migrate -m "Initial database schema"
    ```
3.  **Apply the migrations to create the tables:**
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```
4.  **(Optional) Seed the database** with sample data for a clean demonstration. This script will wipe existing data first.
    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```

---

## 5. Running the Application

Once the database is initialized, you can start the Flask development server. This terminal window must be kept running.
```bash
flask run
```
The API is now live and available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 6. How to Test the API

Once the server is running, open a **second terminal** with the virtual environment activated (`source venv/bin/activate`). You can use the following `curl` commands to test the core end-to-end functionality.

1.  **Check the seeded stations:**
    ```bash
    curl [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/stations](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/stations)
    ```

2.  **Simulate reporting a new incident:**
    This tests the main workflow: creating an incident, finding a drone, and simulating an ATC request.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents) \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "latitude": -26.2041,
        "longitude": 28.0473,
        "description": "Robbery in progress in Johannesburg Central.",
        "reporter_id": 1
    }'
    ```

3.  **Update the new incident's status** (assuming it has `id: 1`):
    ```bash
    curl -X PATCH [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents/1](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents/1) \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"status": "RESOLVED"}'
    ```

4.  **Verify the update:**
    ```bash
    curl [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents/1](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/incidents/1)
    ```

## 7. API Documentation

For a more detailed and interactive way to explore the API, I have integrated Flasgger to provide a live Swagger UI documentation page.

* **How to access:** While the Flask server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    **`http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs`**

This interactive page allows you to see all available endpoints, their expected parameters, and test them directly from the browser.

## Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, I have identified several exciting potential enhancements for this project that would build upon the current foundation:

* **Facial Recognition Integration:** Develop a separate microservice to handle image analysis. This service would receive images captured by drones at an incident scene and integrate with a mock Department of Home Affairs API to identify persons of interest, linking their identity back to the incident report. This demonstrates an understanding of microservice architecture and secure third-party API integration.

* **Asynchronous Task Handling:** Integrate a task queue like Celery with Redis to handle time-consuming operations like the ATC clearance request and facial recognition processing. This would prevent the API from blocking and create a more responsive and scalable system.

* **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Implement WebSockets to push live location updates of drones and new incident alerts to a frontend application, creating a real-time command-and-control dashboard for operators.

* **Token-Based Authentication:** Enhance the login system by generating secure JSON Web Tokens (JWT) upon successful login. These tokens would then be required to access protected API endpoints, implementing a stateless and industry-standard security model.
